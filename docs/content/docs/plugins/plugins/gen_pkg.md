The Gen Package plugin allows you to generate MCVM packages from hosting websites such as Smithed or Modrinth. It can do this for a single project, or for many at once. It is used in the [Official Package Repository](https://github.com/mcvm-launcher/packages) to generate packages, which is a good example for how it works.
