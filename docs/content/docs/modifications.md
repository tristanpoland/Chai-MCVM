MCVM and its packages support multiple different types of modifications to the game, such as modloaders and plugin types. The package format attempts to support as many modifications as possible, but that does not mean that every launcher is able to install all of them automatically.

The different types of fields are listed here. Variants may be listed with `supported` or `unsupported` depending on whether MCVM supports installing them.

## Client types (`client_type`)

- `vanilla`: The standard game. (supported)
- `fabric`: The Fabric modloader. (supported)
- `quilt`: The Quilt modloader. (supported)
- `forge`: The MinecraftForge modloader. (unsupported)
- `neoforged`: The NeoForged modloader. (unsupported)
- `liteloader`: The LiteLoader modloader. (unsupported)
- `risugamis`: Risugami's modloader. (unsupported)
- `rift`: The Rift modloader. (unsupported)

- `forge` (unsupported)
