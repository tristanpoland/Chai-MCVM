# 🚀 MCVM

MCVM is a Minecraft launcher and ecosystem meant to provide a plugin system and better interface with custom content such as mods and resource packs.

In the official launcher and many alternative ones, you have to waste time moving files in and out of folders, downloading mods from sketchy websites, setting up servers, and sharing your config to play with friends. MCVM hopes to alleviate some of these pains with its smart systems for configuration sharing and package management.

In addition, MCVM has a ton of flexibility, allowing you to build your perfect launcher by hand, or just use the amazing tools already built by the community.

# ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Launching**: Launch both clients and servers seamlessly.
- 🔌**Plugin System**: Many of MCVM's features are split into separate plugins. You can use this system to add your own features to the launcher as well.
- ⌨️ **CLI**: An intuitive and ergonomic command-line interface makes using MCVM easy and satisfying.
- 💼 **Instances**: Separate game installations into self-contained instances.
- 📄 **Game Options**: Specify client options and server properties using a backwards compatible format that can be shared between instances.
- 📦 **Packages**: Automatically install mods, resource packs, and other addons with a novel package format and intelligent dependency management.
- 📥 **Install Everything**: Use many of the popular loaders, like Fabric and Quilt, along with server implementations like Paper, with automatic installation.
- 🪪 **User Management**: Set up as many users as you want, and log them in and out as needed.
- 🗃️ **Profiles**: Easily share settings across multiple instances.
- 💾 **Backups**: Create archived snapshots of the files you want, and not the ones you don't.
- ⚡**Speed**: Probably one of the fastest launchers on the market. Download files concurrently with efficient caching and optimal disk usage.
- 🛠️ **Deep Configuration**: Sensible defaults, but plenty of options and escape hatches to make MCVM work for you.
- 🔒 **Robustness**: A lot of design work has gone into making MCVM resilient, secure, and future-proof.
- ✅ **Compatability**: MCVM is designed to work on as many operating systems and architectures as possible.

# ➕ More Info

### Packages

**_Packages_** are a big selling point of MCVM. You just configure what packages you want on a profile or instance and all the files you need for some addon are automatically installed. The `sodium` package, for example, when installed on a profile, will add the Sodium jar file to your mods folder only on client instances.

#### A universal format

Packages are designed in such a way that they work with any hosting system. Because they can download files from any URL, packages serve as an intermediary for the formats and conventions of many different websites.

#### Package relationships

MCVM's packaging format provides the ability to model complex relationships between packages. You won't have to worry about getting all of the correct dependencies for your packages, as they will be automatically installed.

#### Flexibility with scripting

Packages can be more than just an index of files. They can be scripts which run simple logic to determine dependencies and addon files depending on the conditions of the environment.

#### Safety

Packages are made to be as secure as possible. Even though they have scripting capabilities, they are in a controlled environment with no uneeded access to the system or ability to run arbitrary code. Public repositories will be screened often to ensure quality.

#### Control

You don't have to just use the packages from the official repositories. You can use whatever local or remote package repository you please with whatever priority, as long as they match the API standard. The syncing of package files from repositories is a separate process that only happens when you explicitly say so. Changes to packages will never break your game without your knowledge.

# 👷 Use Cases

MCVM has many use cases for different applications

### A command-line launcher

This is the main use case of most people, and is an important focus of the ecosystem.

### A GUI launcher (planned)

All the functionalities of the CLI in a more approachable format as a desktop application.

### A library for your launcher

You can use the MCVM library as a base for the functionalities of your launcher. Even if you don't use the packaging formats, MCVM contains functions to launch the game in a simple way, as well as customize the launch process to your liking.

### A server management tool

The MCVM CLI is the perfect assistant for server managers. The way that it groups configuration for instances makes it easy to orchestrate multiple running servers at once. Plugins can add features like launching on remote machines, config management, automatic scaling and restarts, and proxy support.

### A packaging format

Launchers can use the different MCVM crates to parse, validate, evaluate, and host MCVM packages.

# 👍 Status

Right now, the launcher and library have most of the core features implemented. The main thing that needs completed is the GUI version of the launcher, and a public repository where anyone can upload packages. If you see something you want that isn't there, try contributing!

### Things that need to be completed before 1.0.0:

- Installing NeoForge
- A graphical version of the launcher
