#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! This is the library for MCVM and pretty much all of the features that the
//! CLI uses.
//!
//! Note: The asynchronous functions in this library expect the use of the Tokio runtime and may panic
//! if it is not used
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `arc`: MCVM uses Rc's in a couple places. Although these are more performant than Arc's, they
//! may not be compatible with some async runtimes. With this feature enabled, these Rc's will be replaced with
//! Arc's where possible.
//! - `builder`: Enable or disable the config builder system, which isn't needed if you are just deserializing the standard config.
//! - `disable_profile_update_packages`: A workaround for `https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/102211`. If you are
//! getting higher-ranked lifetime errors when running the update_profiles function, try enabling this. When enabled, the
//! update_profiles function will no longer update packages at all.
//! - `schema`: Enable generation of JSON schemas using the `schemars` crate
